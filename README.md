AutoVap is an interactive web application for predicting the standard enthalpy of vaporization of chemical structures. Built on a supervised machine learning model with RDKit-derived descriptors, AutoVap achieves predictions with 96 % accuracy, across diverse chemical families. The platform allows users to input SMILES notation and obtain both predictions and associated uncertainties through a simple interface.

AutoVap is based on the work published in **Chemosphere** by [Ferraz-Caetano, et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.142257) and the original experimental dataset can be found in the [Zenodo repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11127879).
