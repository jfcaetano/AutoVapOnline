# AutoVap: An Interactive Machine Learning Tool for Predicting Vaporization Enthalpy

AutoVap is an interactive web application for predicting the standard enthalpy of vaporization ($\Delta_\mathrm{vap} H_\mathrm{m}^\circ$) of molecular structures. Built on a supervised machine learning model with RDKit-derived descriptors, AutoVap achieves predictions with 96 % accuracy, across diverse chemical families. The platform allows users to input SMILES notation and obtain both predictions and associated uncertainties through a simple interface.
