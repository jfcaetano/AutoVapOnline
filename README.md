# AutoVap: An Interactive Machine Learning Tool for Predicting Vaporization Enthalpy

AutoVap is an interactive web application for predicting the standard enthalpy of vaporization of chemical structures. Built on a supervised machine learning model with RDKit-derived descriptors, AutoVap achieves predictions with 96 % accuracy, across diverse chemical families. The platform allows users to input SMILES notation and obtain both predictions and associated uncertainties through a simple interface.

AutoVap is based on the article published in the **Chemosphere** by [Ferraz-Caetano, et al (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.142257).
