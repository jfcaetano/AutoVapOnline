# AutoVap: An Interactive Machine Learning Tool for Predicting Vaporization Enthalpy

ChemEco is a machine learning-powered tool that predicts Environmental Price values (`Lower`, `Median`, `Upper`) for chemical substances based on their SMILES representation and environmental medium. The model provides **per-sample uncertainty estimates** by combining ensemble standard deviation and benchmark RÂ²-based error.

Environmental Prices are metrics to quantify the social costs of pollution, published in the **Environmental Prices Handbook** by [CE Delft](https://cedelft.eu/publications/environmental-prices-handbook-2024-eu27-version/).
